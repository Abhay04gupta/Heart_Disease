This project aims to develop a predictive model for detecting heart failure using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The focus is on individuals with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing heart disease. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature selection, model building, and visualization to draw conclusions about the factors influencing heart disease prediction.
